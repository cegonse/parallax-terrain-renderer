# parallax-terrain-renderer

This is the source code for a terrain rendering engine using OpenGL and combining tessellation shaders with per-pixel displacement mapping techniques that I developed as my Bs. C. final project.
The solution includes a 3D terrain viewing application, a terrain project editor and a testing application to evaluate the performance of the rendering engine. It makes use of OpenGL 4.3, tessellation
and geometry shaders and combines them with per-pixel displacement mapping techniques based on parallax mapping, binary searches and linear searches.

The project has been featured in the followin papers, which explains the mathematical details of the implemented algorithms:
